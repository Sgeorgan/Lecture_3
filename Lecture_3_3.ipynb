[Compound statements](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#compound-statements) are a way of writing multiple statements on the same line to make the code shorter, but perhaps they are also more difficult to read. Thus, [PEP 8 recommends avoiding compound statements in general](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#other-recommendations).
